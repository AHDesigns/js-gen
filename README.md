# Js Gen ![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ahdesigns/js-gen)

Javascript/ Typescript boilerplate generator for node and/or react projects.

Inspired by [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), quickly generate the boilerplate to run a typescript or javascript project with an opinionated setup including:  
- eslint (with optional typescript support)
- prettier
- jest (with babel for parsing `import` statements)
- tsconfig
- create-react-app for react projects

All config files are stored inside of a `.config` folder for a cleaner project.
